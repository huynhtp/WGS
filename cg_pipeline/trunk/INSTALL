PREREQUISITES/DEPENDENCIES

This package and its dependencies and databases require approximately 100 GB of free disk space.

The following packages (and their dependencies) are required for the operation of cg_pipeline.

Perl modules (many modules may already be installed by default; CPAN is the preferred installer)
  BerkeleyDB
  BioPerl (>= 1.6)
  Cwd
  Data::Dumper # just for debugging purposes
  Date::Format
  Exporter
  File::Basename
  File::Copy
  File::Path
  File::Spec
  File::Temp
  FindBin
  Getopt::Long
  IPC::Open2
  List::Util
  Storable
  Switch
  Sys::Hostname
  XML::DOM
  XML::DOM::XPath
  XML::LibXML::Reader
NCBI BLAST (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/)
AMOS 2.0.8 (http://amos.sourceforge.net/)
Glimmer3 (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/glimmer/)
PSORTb (http://www.psort.org/psortb/)
tRNAscan-SE (http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/)
RNAmmer (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?rnammer)
(Note: In case of problems installing tRNAscan-SE from the authors' website, a distribution is available from our website at http://nbase.biology.gatech.edu/download.html)

The following packages are required. However, their installation may present some difficulties, and parts of the pipeline will still be able to function without them.

TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/)
SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/)
Newbler (Roche 454 offInstrumentApps) (required for 454 Pyrosequencing mode of the assembly stage only)
InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/)
(Note: Additional instructions for installing InterProScan are available in the file README.iprscan)

The following packages are optional, and their use as part of the pipeline requires manual operation or changes to the pipeline configuration.

MAUVE (http://asap.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve/)
FSFind (http://topaz.gatech.edu/~kislyuk/fsfind/)

MEMORY REQUIREMENTS

Memory requirements vary per genome. We found that serial runs of 454 Pyrosequencing datasets for 2 MB long bacterial genomes required a maximum of approx. 4 GB of RAM.

STORAGE REQUIREMENTS

The total storage required for all databases downloaded by the pipeline is roughly 50 GB. The temporary space required to run on a 2 MB long bacterial genome is roughly 1 GB.


INSTALLATION

To install the package, first unpack the archive and type "make" in the resulting directory. This will download and initialize the required databases. The complete process takes about a day.

Next, type "make install" to install the package in your system. By default, the package will install in /opt/cg_pipeline. Because of the size of the databases, they will be moved rather than copied from the current directory, in the hope that the target directory is on the same filesystem.

If you do not have administrator privileges on your system, or if you require a different installation directory, pass the environment variable DESTDIR when running "make install". For example:

make install DESTDIR="${HOME}/cg_pipeline"

Finally, to be able to run cg_pipeline from any directory, add the scripts subdirectory to the PATH variable in your shell, e.g.:

PATH="${PATH}:/opt/cg_pipeline/scripts"


CONFIGURATION

Default settings and the locations of databases are set in the configuration file [DESTDIR]/cg_pipeline/conf/cgpipelinerc. You should make sure these directories exist and contain the necessary databases before running any applications.

USAGE

See the README file for usage instructions.
